    <p>This chart graphs the distribution of all common jobs among males and females
      surveyed in the 1847 census. Each dot represents one individual, where the
      dot's position is based on the individual's occupation and id (assigned
      based on where they were listed in the original data). Hover over each dot
      to see the details for that individual. Use the buttons to toggle between
      male only, female only, and both displays. We wanted to incorporate a chart
      that helps illustrate the sense that these data depict the lives of many individual
      people, so this scatter plot helps do so even though graphing according to id
      is not necessarily the most logical.</p>
