## Philadelphia 1847 Census Project - Introduction
The special collections visualization project was proposed by **Celia Caust-Ellenbogen** and **Jordan Landes** of the [Friends Historical Library](https://www.swarthmore.edu/friends-historical-library) at Swarthmore College as part of the 2019 Swarthmore Projects for Educational Exploration & Development ([SPEED](https://www.swarthmore.edu/its/swarthmore-projects-educational-exploration-and-development-speed-program)) Program. The project is led by **Nabil Kashyap** of Swarthmore College, as well as **Alice Huang** ('22), **Bilal Soukouna** ('22), **Helen Huh** ('21), and **Katie Knox** ('21).

The Friends Historical Library collects and preserves a large number of documents connected to the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) from the mid-seventeenth century to the present. One of these documents is the original manuscript of a census of the 1847 African-American population in Philadelphia, collected by a committee of Quakers. The census contains 43 data points for over 4,000 families, offering a rich resource for researchers to better understand individuals' lives during this time. In 2002, the Friends Historical Library created an online exhibit to display the data contained in the census. 

## Motivation
The special collections visualization project aims to revitalize the original online exhibit for the Philadelphia 1847 Census data. The new site presents the data in a streamlined, accessible setting where researchers or students can explore the stories of these individuals easily. Additionally, the site houses a number of data visualizations that add interactivity to the census data.
